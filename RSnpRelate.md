Data is first loaded from TASSEL and PLINK  
Comparison is done using dendextend  
There seems to be a difference in the 1-IBS matrices computed in TASSEL and in PLINK  
Also when filtering Tassel data e.g. using thinning (only 1 snp per 1kb) 
Hence SNPRelate was used as well 
SNPRelate converts the vcf file this only needs to be done once is commented here
